Analyzing Pricing Inefficiencies in Professional Tennis Match Odds Using Data-Driven Probabilities
Project Overview

This project examines how accurately bookmaker odds reflect the true probability of match outcomes in professional tennis. Using historical match data, player performance metrics, and tournament context, the analysis estimates match-level win probabilities using data-driven models and compares these estimates with market-implied probabilities derived from bookmaker odds.

The objective is not to develop a betting system, but to evaluate how probabilistic models compare to market pricing and to identify areas where historical data may systematically over- or under-estimate outcome likelihoods.

Project Question

How accurately do bookmaker odds reflect the true probability of match outcomes in professional tennis, and can historical match data identify patterns where odds systematically over- or under-estimate the likelihood of a player winning?

Data

The analysis uses publicly available historical professional tennis match results and bookmaker odds. Data is cleaned, merged, and analysed using Python and pandas.

Methods

Data ingestion and cleaning

Feature engineering (player form, surface, tournament context)

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Probability estimation using simple statistical models

Comparison of model-estimated probabilities with market-implied probabilities

Tools

Python

pandas

numpy

matplotlib
